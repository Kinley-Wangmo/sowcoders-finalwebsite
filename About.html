              <p> Our mission is to implement energy audit of buildings and to propose energy saving measures with cost benefit analysis.
              With the development of the economy, a rise in population and people's living standards lead to the proportionate increase in per capita energy consumption.Therfore,
               it's important to promote energy conservation and efficiency to enhance energy security.For the effective management of energy in building, energy auditing is preferred. </p>

          <h3>About me</h3>
                I am Kinley Wangmo from Bhutan. Bhutan is a small country located between India and China with a  total area of 38,394 sq km with a population of 771608.
                In the olden days, Bhutan used firewood as a source of energy.Now,Hydropower is one of the most important and strategic renewable energy sources for Bhutan and its
                primarily dependent on hydropower.Well, I am sure that everyone really aware of energy that we used and try to utilze the energy in better way.However,the methods that
                are presented in this website will encourage you to save energy and advise others as well.The bill you got monthly will not dread if you remember to utilze properly.
