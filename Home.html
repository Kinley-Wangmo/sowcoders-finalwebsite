       <!-- paragraph 1 Problem Intro -->
       <h3>Energy consumption.</h3>
<p>The electricity consumption differs due to the size and orientation of the building,geographical location, number, and equipment type.Power is being
   wasted by users keeping the devices unplugged when it is not primarily used assuming that they are either completely off or consumes no power at all.
    Sometimes it was found that the corridor and toilet lights in buildings were also observed ON during the day time.
   The introduction of new technologies and increasing the number of existing equipment also results in more energy consumption.</p>
