<h3>About Product - Building energy audit</h3>
An energy audit is an inspection survey and analysis of energy flow for energy conservation in a building. It includes either a process or system to reduce the amount of
  energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output.Energy auditing plays an important role in managing the energy for the major development of countries.
   Energy auditing looks into the inadequacies in the use of energy and recommends feasible solutions. It helps in reducing the energy cost in facilities and reduce environmental damages </p>

<h2>Types of energy audit</h2>
<p>  There are three types of energy audit as mentioned below:
1.	Walk through energy audit
It is a simple analysis and does not require measuring instruments. The site inspection was done to identify the energy performance of the electricity consuming facilities.
The areas where the energy is being wasted are also determined. Based on the walk-through audit, immediate energy saving measures are proposed which were more of general and inexpensive.
2.	Targeted energy audit
The targeted energy audit was done by setting a target for a particular system. The result obtained from walk through audit was analyzed and identified major energy consuming facilities.
The facility which consumes maximum energy was set as a target and a detailed energy audit was carried out for the targeted facility. Then the energy saving measures are proposed along with cost benefit analysis.
3.	Detailed energy audit
It is a most comprehensive audit and time consuming. The measuring instruments are required to conduct such type of energy audit. The energy consuming facilities and areas where energy wastges is maximum are also identified.
 Energy saving measures are proposed which are categorized as short, medium and long term. Cost benefit analysis are also done to determine the payback periods. After completion of an energy audit, recommendations are provided
  for different electricity consuming facilities.</p>

<h2> Propose energy-saving opportunities</h2>
<p>The energy-saving opportunities are recommended based on the results of the walk through energy audit and detailed energy audit. However, the complete energy-saving strategies cannot be put forwarded as it is differentiated
   into three categories. Energy-saving opportunities can be provided for immediate use only.
   It can provide collaborative energy saving opportunities which require a less economic contribution.</p>

<p>Three parts of energy saving measures as follow:<p>

  <li> Short term measures</li>
  <li> Medium term measures</li>
  <li> Long term measures</li>

   <p> The short term measures include those of immediate saving measures which can be applied within a short period of time, whereas medium and long term measures require further investigation.</p>

  <h2>Solutions</h2>
  <p>The ways to save energy is to put off the lights during day time,replace the incandescent bulb by LED bulb,toilet and corridor light by motion sensor bulb.
  The other way for the recommended energy saving measures and found feasible to use the proposed system is carried out by the method of cost benefit analysis.

Replacement of 36W tube light with 18 W T8 LED tube light:
Existing system
36 W tube light =15 numbers
36 W tube light = 36 x 15 x 10 x 365
                                          = 1971kWh
Proposed system
Energy consumed by 16W LED tube light = Rating of tube light (Watt) x number of tube x Hours of operation x days in year used.
                                                         = 18 x 15x 10 x 365
                                                         = 985.5Wh per year
Energy saved per year =1971 -985.5
                                     = 985.5kWh
Annual cost saving@Nu.4.10/kWh = Nu.4040.55
Cost of 18W LED tube light = Nu.250
Total investment = 250 x 15
                            =Nu.3750
Payback Period = 3750 / 4040.55
                          = 0.92 years
